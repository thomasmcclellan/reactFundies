# Main Concepts - Hello World
The smallest `React` example looks like this:

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello, world</h1>
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

It displays a heading saying `Hello, world` on the page.

## How to Read This Guide:
In this guide, we will examine the building blocks of `React` apps:  elements and components.  Once you master them, you can create complex apps from small reusable pieces.

  > **TIP**: This guide is designed for people who prefer **learning concepts step by step.  If you prefer to learn by doing, check out the [practical tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).  Yo umight find this guide and the tutorial complementary to each other.

This is the first chapter in a step-by-step guide about main `React` concepts. You can find a list of all its chapters in the navigation sidebar.  If you're reading this from a mobile device, you can access the navigation by pressing the button in the bottom right corner of your screen.

Every chapter in this guide builds on the knowledge introduced in earlier chapters.  **You can learn most of `React` by reading the 'Main Concepts' guide chapters in the order they appear in the sidebar**.  For example, 'Learning `JSX`' is the next chapter after this one.
