# Advanced Guides - Forwarding Refs
Ref forwarding is a technique for automatically passing a [ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) through a component to one of its children.  This is typically not necessary for most components in the application.  However, it can be useful for some kinds fo components, especially in reusable component libraries.  The most common scenarios are described below.

---

## Forwarding Refs to `DOM` Components:
Consider a `FancyButton` component that renders the native `button` `DOM` element:

```js
function FancyButton(props) {
  return (
    <button className='FancyButton'>
      {props.children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

`React` components hide their implementation details, including their rendered output.  Other components using `FancyButton` **usually will not need to** obtain a ref to the inner `button` `DOM` element.   This is good because it prevents components from relying on each other's `DOM` structure too much.

Although such encapsulation is desirable for application-level components like `FeedStory` or `Comment`, it can be inconvenient for highly reusable 'leaf' components like `FancyButton` or `MyTextInput`.  These components tend to be used throughout the application in a similar manner as a regular `DOM` `button` and `input`, nad accessing their `DOM` nodes may be unavoidable for managing focus, selection, or animations.

**Ref forwarding is an opt-in feature that lets some components take a ref they receive, and pass it further down (in other words, 'forward' it) to a child.**

In the example below, `FancyButton` uses `React.forwardRef` to obtain the `ref` passed to it, and then forward it to the `DOM` `button` that it renders:

```js
const FancyButton = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => (
  <button ref={ref} className='FancyButton'>
    {props.children}
  </button>
));

// YOu can now get a ref directly to the DOM button: 
const ref = React.createRef();

<FancyButton ref={ref}>Click me!</FancyButton>;
```

This way, components using `FancyButton` can get a ref to the underlying `button` `DOM` node and access it if necessary--just like if they used a `DOM` `button` directly.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of what happens in the above example:
  1. We create a `React` ref by calling `React.createRef` and assign it to a `ref` variable
  2. We pass our `ref` down to `<FancyButton ref={ref}>` by specifying it as a `JSX` attribute
  3. `React` passes the `ref` to the `(props, ref) => ...` `function` inside `forwardRef` as a second argument
  4. We forward this `ref` argument down to `<button ref={ref}>` by specifying it as a `JSX` attribute
  5. When the ref is attached, `ref.current` will point to the `<button>` `DOM` node

  > **NOTE**: The second `ref` argument only exists when you define a component with `React.forwardRef` call.  Regular `function` or `class` components don't receive the `ref` argument, and ref is not available in props either.
  >
  > Ref forwarding is not limited to `DOM` components.  You can forward refs to `class` component instances too.

## Note For Component Library Maintainers:
**When you start using `forwardRef` in a component library, you should treat it as a breaking change and release a new major version of your library**.  This is because your library likely has an observably different behavior (such as what refs get assigned to, and what types are exported), and this can break apps and other libraries that depend on the old behavior.

Conditionally applying `React.forwardRef` when it exists is also not recommended for the same reasons:  it changes how your library behaves and can break your users' app when they upgrade `React` itself.

---

## Forwarding Refs In Higher-Order Components:
This technique can also be particularly useful with higher-order components (HOC).  Let's start with an example HOC that logs component props to the console:

```js
function logProps(WrappedComponent) {
  class LogProps extends React.Component {
    componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
      console.log('old props:', prevProps);
      console.log('new props:', this.props);
    }

    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  }

  return LogProps;
}
```

The `logProps` HOC passes all `props` through the component it wraps, so the rendered output will be the same.  For example, we can use this HOC to log all props that get passed to our `FancyButton` component:

```js
class FancyButton extends React.Component {
  focus() {
    ...
  }
  ...
}

// Rather than exporting FancyButton, we export LogProps.
// It will render a FancyButton though
export default logProps(FancyButton);
```

There is one caveat to the above example:  refs will not get passed through.  That's because `ref` is not a prop.  Like `key`, it's handled differently by `React`.  If you add a ref to a HOC, the ref will refer to the outermost container component, not the wrapped component.

This means that refs intended for our `FancyButton` component will actually be attached to the `LogProps` component:

```js
import FancyButton from './FancyButton';

const ref = React.createRef();

// The FancyButton component we imported is the LogProps HOC even though the referred output will be the same, our ref will point to the LogProps instead of the inner FancyButton component!  This means we can't call e.g. ref.current.focus()
<FancyButton
  label='Click Me'
  handleClick={handleClick}
  ref={ref}
/>;
```

Fortunately, we can explicitly forward refs to the inner `FancyButton` component using the `React.forwardRef` API.  `React.forwardRef` accepts a render `function` that receives `props` and `ref` parameters adn returns a `React` node.  For example:

```js
function logProps(Component) {
  class LogProps extends React.Component {
    componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
      console.log('old prop:', prevProps);
      console.log('new prop:', this.props);
    }

    render() {
      const {forwardedRef, ...rest} = this.props;

      // Assign the custom prop 'forwardedRef' as a ref
      return <Component ref={forwardedRef} {...rest} />
    }
  }

  // Note the second param 'ref' provided by React.forwardRef.  We can pas it along to LogProps as a regular prop, e.g. 'forwardedRef' and it can then be attached to the Component 
  return React.forwardedRef((props, ref) => {
    return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;
  });
}
```

## Displaying A Custom Name In DevTools:
`React.forwardRef` accepts a render `function`.  `React` DevTools uses this `function` to determine what to display for the ref forwarding component.

For example, the following component will appear as `ForwardRef` in the DevTools:

```js
const WrappedComponent = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;
});
```  

If you name the render `function`, DevTools will also include its name (e.g. `ForwardRef(myFunction)`):

```js
const WrappedComponent = React.forwardRef(
  function myFunction(props, ref) {
    return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;
  }
);
```

You can even set the `function`'s `displayName` property to include the component youâ€™re wrapping:

```js
function logProps(Component) {
  class LogProps extends React.Component {
    ...
  }

  function forwardRef(props, ref) {
    return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;
  }

  // Give this component a more helpful display name in DevTools. e.g. "ForwardRef(logProps(MyComponent))"
  const name = Component.displayName || Component.name;
  forwardRef.displayName = `logProps(${name})`;

  return React.forwardRef(forwardRef);
}
```
